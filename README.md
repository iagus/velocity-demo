# SVG animation w/ Velocityjs

Velocity is an animation engine with the same API as jQuery's $.animate().
It works with and without jQuery. It's incredibly fast, and it features color animation, transforms,
loops, easings, SVG support, and scrolling. It is the best of jQuery and CSS transitions combined.
